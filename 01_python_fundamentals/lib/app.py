# ðŸ“š Review:
    # Python Environment Setup
	# Python Debugging Tools
	# Python Data Types 

# ðŸš¨ To enable ipdb debugging, first import "ipdb"
import ipdb

# 1. âœ… Create a condition to check a pet's mood
    # If "pet_mood" is "Hungry!", "Rose needs to be fed."
    # If "pet_mood" is "Rowdy!", "Rose needs a walk."
    # In all other cases, "Rose is all good."

    # Note => Feel free to set your own values for "pet_mood" to view various outputs.

pet_mood = "Hungry!"
pet_name = "Rose"

# ipdb.set_trace()

# if pet_mood == "Hungry!":
#      print("Rose needs to be fed.")
# elif pet_mood == "Rowdy!":
#     print("Rones needs a walk.")
# else:
#     print("Rose is all good!")

# 2. âœ… Create a ternary operator using "pet_mood" as a condition:
    # If pet_food is "Hungry!" => "Rose needs to be fed."
    # In all other cases => "Rose is all good."

# print("Rose needs to be fed.") if pet_mood == "Hungry!" else print("Rose is all good.")

# 3. âœ… Create a function (say_hello) that returns the string "Hello, world!"
    # Test invocation of "say_hello" in ipdb using "say_hello()"
    # say_hello() => "Hello, world!"

#NO HOISTING => CANNOT INVOKE BEFORE DECLARATION

# Declaration
# def say_hello(name="Eddy"):
#     print(f'Hello, {name}!')
# #Invocation
# say_hello("Student")

# 4. âœ… Create a function (pet_greeting) that will return a string with interpolated pet's name
    # Test invocation of "pet_greeting" in ipdb using "pet_greeting()"
    # pet_greeting("Rose") => "Rose says hello!"
    # pet_greeting("Spot") => "Spot says hello!"

# def pet_greeting(name="Pet"):
#     print(f"{name} says hello!")

# pet_greeting("Dyno")

# 5. âœ… Move conditional logic from Deliverable 1 into a function (pet_status) so that we may use it with different pets / moods
    # Test invocation of "pet_status" in ipdb using "pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood)"
    # pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!") => "Rose needs to be fed."
    # pet_greeting("Spot", "Rowdy!") => "Spot needs a walk."
    # pet_greeting("Bud", "Relaxed") => "Bud is all good."

# def pet_status(pet_name, pet_mood):
    
#     # Function (Local) scope
#     if pet_mood == "Hungry!":
#         print(f"{pet_name} needs to be fed!")
#     elif pet_mood == "Rowdy!":
#         print(f"{pet_name} needs to be walked!")
#     else:
#         print(f"{pet_name} is all good!")

# pet_status("Rose", "Hungry!")
# pet_status("Spot", "Rowdy!")
# pet_status("Bud", "Relaxed!")
    
    # Take a moment to note that "pet_name" and "pet_mood" parameters are within Local Scope and take priority over "pet_name" and "pet_mood"
    # in Global Scope.

# 6. âœ… Create a function (pet_birthday) that will increment a pet's age up by 1. Use try / except to handle errors. 
    # If our function is given an incorrect datatype, it should handle the TypeError exception and alert the user
    # pet_birthday(10) => "Happy Birthday! Your pet is now 11."
    # pet_birthday("oops") => "Type Error Occurred"

def pet_birthday(age):
    try:
        age = age + 1
        print(f"Happy Birthday! Your pet is now {age}.")
        # Onlu in the case of TypeError firing do we print the String below.
    except TypeError:
        print("Type Error Occurred!")

pet_birthday("oop")

# ipdb.set_trace()
